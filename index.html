          <h1>Fall Prevention</h1>
            <p>Martha, age 76, was using a cane and having difficulty walking. When asked about her cane use, Mary replied “I started about 3 or 4 months ago. I was having a hard time keeping my balance. I just don’t have the strength I used to.” Why didn’t she come in? Mary said “I didn’t want to be a bother. I didn’t think anything could be done. That I would just had to live with it” After a quick review of her medications to rule them out as the cause, Mary was referred to physical therapy. She eventually became strong enough to stop using her cane. In addition, she was referred to a fall prevention class offered free of charge at a local senior center which Mary said was very helpful.
            
            According to the CDC, one in three adults aged 65 and older falls each year. Of those who fall,20% to 30% suffer moderate to severe injuries that make it hard for them to get around or live independently, and increase their risk of early death. Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuries five times more often than they are for injuries from other causes..</p>

          <h1>Annual Depression Screen</h1>
          <p>Sandra, age 69, had very high results for depression. She wasn’t suicidal but she was heavily weighed down by a sense of sadness and disinterest. No one would have known. Depressed patients don’t usually pick up the phone to say “I need to see the doctor. I’m sad”. The practice arranged for Sandra to speak with counselor specializing in senior depression the next day. They also gave her a prescription and scheduled a follow up visit for the next week. Sandra continued counseling for a few months, started walking, and made some other changes in her life. She showed no sign of depression at her next annual depression screen.
            
            Healthcare providers may mistake an older adult’s symptoms of depression as just a natural reaction to illness or the life changes that occur as we age. Regular screening helps identify individual who need help.</p>

          <h1>Obesity counseling</h1>
          <p>Sam, age 70, was obese. He had been for a long time along with several chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. As part of Sam’s personalized prevention plan, he was scheduled to come back and meet with the doctor for obesity counseling (Intensive Behavioral Therapy). Since there was no co-pay Sam agreed to give it a try, but just once. During those 15 minutes they had a productive interaction that engaged Sam. Together they decided on a short term goal for Sam. The doctor provided helpful information and suggestions. Sam was then scheduled for a follow up session the next week. Sam built on the small success he experienced that week. He continued to lose weight, gain strength, and increase his endurance. Four months later, Sam told the staff, “I can’t believe it. I’m wearing normal shoes and my feet don’t hurt. I can walk almost 2 miles now.” But the best outcome was when Sam was able to stop taking insulin. He was also able to reduce the dosage of his blood pressure medication. “Having this one-on-one time where we only talk about how to get healthier has been amazing. I was tired of hearing how sick I was”, said Sam.
            
            More than one-third of adults over 60 (35.4%) are obese. Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death.</p>
